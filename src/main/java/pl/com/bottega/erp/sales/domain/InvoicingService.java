/**
 * Sample Domain Service that contains logic that:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Does not have a natural place in any aggregate - we don't want to bloat Order with issuance of the Invoice
 * <li> Has broad dependencies - we don't want Order to become a 'God Class'
 * <li> Is used only (or not many) in one Use Case/user Story so is not essential for any Aggregate
 * <ul>
 * 
 * Notice that this Domain Service is managed by Container in order to be able to inject dependencies like Repo
